[ WARN] [1597469347.404395017]: The STL file 'package://turtlebot3_description/meshes/sensors/lds.stl' is malformed. It starts with the word 'solid', indicating that it's an ASCII STL file, but it does not contain the word 'endsolid' so it is either a malformed ASCII STL file or it is actually a binary STL file. Trying to interpret it as a binary STL file instead.
